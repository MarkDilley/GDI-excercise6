People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith and a helping hand

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
Leave them burning and then you're gone
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
