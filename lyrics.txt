Friday night and the lights are low
Anybody could be that guy
And when you get the chance...
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen
You're in the mood for a dance
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
Dig in the Dancing Queen

People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith and a helping hand
