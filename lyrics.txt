People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith and a helping hand

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
And when you get the chance...
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen
