Dig in the Dancing Queen 

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go


Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high


And when you get the chance...
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen


See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on


You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...


You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen
