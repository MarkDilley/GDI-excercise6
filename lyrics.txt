You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine

And when you get the chance...


You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone

You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...


You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen
